GitLab Okta Group Sync
----------------------

Sync GitLab with Okta Groups! Currently GitLab only supports this functionality within their SaaS solution, so I built this to rectify the problem.

One will need to run this script as an administrator from within Self-Hosted GitLab, and expose the variables below as protected environment vars.

Pre-requisite environment variables:
 - GITLAB_TOKEN
 - OKTA_TOKEN
